// Bounded buffers

/**
 * The BoundedBufferWithSemaphores class is likely to run more efficiently than the
 * BoundedBufferWithStateTracking class in ยง 3.3.1 when there are many threads all
 * using the buffer. BoundedBufferWithSemaphores relies on two different underlying wait
 * sets. The  {@link chapter_3.section_3.BoundedBufferWithStateTracking} class gets by with only one, so any emptyto-
 * partial or full-to-partial state transition causes all waiting threads to wake up, including those
 * waiting for the other logical condition and those that will immediately rewait because some other
 * thread took the only item or filled the only available slot.
 * The BoundedBufferWithSemaphores class isolates the monitors for these two conditions.
 * This can be exploited by the underlying Semaphore implementation (see ยง 3.7.1) to eliminate
 * unnecessary context switching by using notify instead of notifyAll. This reduces the worstcase
 * number of wakeups from being a quadratic function of the number of invocations to being linear.
 * More generally, whenever you can isolate a condition using a semaphore, you can usually improve
 * performance as compared to notifyAll-based solutions.
