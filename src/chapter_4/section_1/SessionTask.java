/*
    To enable many sessions to be handled without using many threads, the tasks first must be refactored
        into an event-driven style, where an event here signifies IO availability. In this style, a session consists
        of possibly many executions of its event-triggered task(s), each of which is invoked when input
        becomes available.*/
