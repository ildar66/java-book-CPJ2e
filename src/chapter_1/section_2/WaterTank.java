    //equipped with an available overflow tank.

    //Protocols:
    //constraining when and how messages (operation requests) are processed. For
    //example, we may impose a rule that at most one addWater or removeWater message
    //is processed at any given time or, alternatively, a rule stating that removeWater messages
    //are allowed in the midst of addWater operations.
