// Triggering

/**
 * When the events driving each event-driven task are relatively infrequent, a large number of tasks can
 * be processed by a small number of worker threads. The simplest case occurs when the number of
 * worker threads is exactly one. Here, the worker thread repeatedly polls a list of open sockets to see if
 * they have any input available (via InputStream.available) or have encountered other IOrelated
 * status changes. If so, the worker executes the associated run method.
 * This style of worker thread differs from the ones in ยง 4.1.4.1 in that, rather than pulling tasks from a
 * blocking queue and blindly running them, the worker must repeatedly check a list of registered tasks
 * to see if any can be run. It removes each task from the list only when it claims to have completed.
 * One generic form is:
