 * // Example section
 * An instance class @see {@link TSBoolean} is used to control entry into the synchronized part of
 * the main checking-side method tryTransfer, which is the potential deadlock point in this design. If
 * another transfer is attempted by a savings account while one is executing (always, in this case, one
 * that is initiated by the checking account), then it is just ignored without deadlocking. This is
 * acceptable here since the executing tryTransfer and transferOut operations are based on
 * the most recently updated savings balance anyway.
