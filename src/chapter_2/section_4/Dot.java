 * are immutable, the loc reference is mutable. While synchronization of the accessor method
 * location might be loosened in accord with the considerations in ยง 2.4.1, the shiftX method
 * must be synchronized (or perhaps otherwise modified) in order to preclude multiple concurrent
 * executions in which different versions of loc are obtained when accessing loc.x() and loc.y().
