// Read-Only Adapters para

/**
 * The most secure version of this scheme takes a bit of work to set up:
 * • Define a base interface describing some non-mutative functionality.
 * • Optionally, define a subinterface that supports additional update methods used in the normal
 * mutable implementation class.
 * • Define a read-only adapter that forwards only the exported operations. For added security,
 * declare that the immutable class is final. The use of final means that when you think
 * you have an immutable object, you really do — it's not of some subclass that supports
 * mutable operations as well.
 * These classes could be used, for example, in: @see {@link AccountHolder}
 * The java.common.Collection framework uses a variant of this scheme. Rather than declaring a
 * separate immutable interface, the main Collection interface permits mutative methods to throw
 * UnsupportedOperationExceptions. Anonymous read-only adapter classes throw these
 * exceptions on all attempted update operations. They can be constructed via, for example:
 * List l = new ArrayList();
 * // ...
 * untrustedObject.use(Collections.unmodifiableList(l));
