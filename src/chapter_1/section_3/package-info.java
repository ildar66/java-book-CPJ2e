 * Design Forces
 * Safety: Nothing bad ever happens to an object. Safety failures lead to unintended behavior at run time — things just start going wrong.
 * Liveness: Something eventually happens within an activity. Liveness failures lead to no behavior — things just stop running.
 * Reusability: The utility of objects and classes across multiple contexts.
 * Performance: The extent to which activities execute soon and quickly.
